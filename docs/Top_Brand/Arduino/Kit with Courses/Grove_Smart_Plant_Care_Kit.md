Grove Smart Plant Care Kit is a ease-to-use and advanced tool kit for you to develop a smart system for plants.
It favors  extensibility to achieve more applications with just a few adjustments.
The kit implements two functions. One is to detect environment factors affecting plant growth such as soil moisture, illumination intensity, temperature and air humidity, all the data detected can be read on OLED display. Another one is to water plants automatically through the environment monitoring.
