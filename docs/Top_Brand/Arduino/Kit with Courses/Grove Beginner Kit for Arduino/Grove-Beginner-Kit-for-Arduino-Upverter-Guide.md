## Make Your Customized Arduino Board for Under $50

By utilizing the strong production chain of Seeed and the convenience of Upverter, prototyping has never been easier. Customize your own Arduino board for under $50, including design, PCB manufacture, components procurement, assembly and international shipping.
Let's see how it works:


## Background

If you don’t want to work on schematic or layout yourself, but you want to convert your prototype based on the Seeed’s modules into an integrated product, we highly recommend you to try [**Upverter**](https://geppetto.seeedstudio.com/).

Upverter is, by far, the easiest and least expensive way to produce production-quality electronics. You don’t need to know about resistors, capacitors, inductors, routing paths or anything EE to design your own module. Upverter is drag & drop simple... anyone can create professional IoT devices. To make it more convenient for you, Geppeto has a library for Seeed, so you can design your own Grove modules with ease!

## Upverter Seeed Design Using Guide

### Open the Design 

- Step1. Click to open Upverter + Seeed page.

### Customize Your Own Beginner Kit

Now you can add or remove modules to suit your needs and quickly build your own Beginner Kit. Like in the previou video, it is simple humidity demo, when the humidity is over 50%, the light will be on to remind you.  Based on the grove beginner kit, you can have many usefuly demo. We will use that small demo as example to demonstarte how easy it is for anyone to customize his/her own board.

If you customized based on grove beginner kit, you can have one board with your name on it under $50（ with design fee, pcb and pcba assemly fee and international shipping fee);

Let's get started!
1. Finish your prototype with grove beginner kit to validate your idea.  
2. Login Upverter in Seeed and open the grove beginner kit design;

6.  Congratulations! You have finished the design of your (first)board. All you need to do is wait for the package arrive. 

If you have any special requirement for your board, you can send email to us ( fusion@seeed.cc)  after  you place the order (like the pcb color, or even the shape of the board), we will have engineer work on it. All you need to do is to make your idea come true with our grove beginner kit and other grove sensors and tell us through upverter. Seeed will handle the rest of the work, you will get a board with your name around 7 working days in a reasonable price, possibley under $50.
We will have more grove modules coming into upverter and it will empower the capabilities of your demo. Stay tuned. Let us know if you have any other suggestion for our campaign, contact us at fusion@seeed.cc
