:::note
    We recommend using the latest version of the Arduino DIE.
:::

## Setup the Arduino IDE

### For Window and Mac OS X

Download the corresponding software,and click the setup.exe,then follow the instruction will be OK.

### For Linux

Please go to  ![Installing Arduino on Linux](http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux)

## Connect Seeeduino to PC

Connect the Seeeduino board to your computer using the USB cable. The green power LED (labeled PWR) should go on.

## Install the driver

### Installing drivers for the Seeeduino with window7

* Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin its driver installation process. After a few moments, the process will fail.
* Open the Device Manager by right clicking “My computer” and selecting control panel.

* Look under Ports (COM &amp; LPT). You should see an open port named "USB Serial Port" Right click on the "USB Serial Port" and choose the "Update Driver Software" option.

* Next, choose the "Browse my computer for Driver software" option.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Download_Arduino_and_install_Arduino_driver/img/Driver2.jpg)

* Finally, select the driver file named "FTDI USB Drivers", located in the "Drivers" folder of the Arduino Software download.

<font color="red"><strong>Note:</strong> the FTDI USB Drivers are from Arduino. But when you install drivers for other Controllers, such as Xadow Main Board, Seeeduino Clio, Seeeduino Lite,you need to download corresponding driver file and save it. And select the driver file you have downloaded.</font>

* The below dialog boxes automatically appears if you have installed driver successfully.

### Installing drivers for the Seeeduino with window8

You should save these files which you are editing before installing driver with window8，because there will several power off during operating.

* Press “Windows Key” +”R”

* Enter shutdown.exe /r /o /f /t 00

* Click the "OK" button.

* System will restart to a "Choose an option" screen

* Select "Advanced options" from "Troubleshoot" screen

* Select "Windows Startup Settings" from "Advanced options" screen

* Click "Restart" button

* System will restart to "Advanced Boot Options" screen

* Select "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement"

* Once the system starts, you can install the Arduino drivers as same as Windows

### Installing drivers for the Seeeduino with Mac OS

* Enter page: [https://www.ftdichip.com](https://www.ftdichip.com).

* Download Driver for the Mac OS X version, named 2.2.18 (32bit)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Download_Arduino_and_install_Arduino_driver/img/Driver7.png)

* Open the driver file which you just download, and double click FTDIUSBSerialDriver_10_4_10_5_10_6_10_7.mpkg

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Download_Arduino_and_install_Arduino_driver/img/Driver8.png)

## Install the Driver

First of all, you need to:

* **Get a Micro-USB cable**
  * You need a Micro-USB cable first; the data cable of an Android Phone will do fine.
If you can't find one, you can buy one [here](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Micro-USB-Cable-48cm-p-1475.html?cPath=98_100).

* **Connect the board**
  * The Seeeduino V4.2 automatically draw power from either the USB connection to the computer or an external power supply. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable. The green power LED (labelled **PWR**) should go on.

### For Windows

:::note
This drive is available for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10.

* Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin its driver installation process. After a few moments, the process will fail, despite best efforts.
* Click on the Start Menu, and open up the Control Panel.
* While in the Control Panel, navigate to System and Security. Next, click on System. Once the System window is up, open the **Device Manager**.
* Look under Ports (COM & LPT). You should find an open port named "Seeeduino v4.2". If there is no COM & LPT section, look under "Other Devices" for "Unknown Device".
* Right click on the "Seeeduino v4.2" port and choose the "Update Driver Software" option.
* Next, choose the "Browse my computer for Driver software" option.
* Finally, navigate to and select the driver file named "seeed_usb_serial.inf"
* Windows will finish up the driver installation from there.

### For Mac OSX

You don't need to install any drivers.

### For Linux

## Getting Started on Linux

For using on Linux, please go to [Installing Arduino on Linux](http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux)

Seeeduino v4.2 is fully compatible with Arduino UNO. The mainly difference list below:

* Use a micro USB to power and program the board
* 3 on-board Grove connector
* 3.3/5V system power switch
* DCDC circuit instead of LDO, more efficiency
* Others circuit improve

#### Q2. I can't upload my sketch to Seeeduino v4.2

Please check,

* If the Power LED on
* If you choose the right Port and Board (Seeeduino v4.2)
* Close and reopen Arduino IDE and try again

#### Q3. Where can I find technical support if I have some other issue

You can post a question to [Seeed Forum](https://community.seeedstudio.com/discover.html?t=Arduino) .
