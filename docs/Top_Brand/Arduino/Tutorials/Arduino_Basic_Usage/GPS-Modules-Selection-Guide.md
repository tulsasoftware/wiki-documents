We have released various types of GPS Modules in recent years. Let's take a close look at them and figure out which one is best suited for you!

For all the GPS or Communication modules in our bazaar, please click [Seeed Studio Bazaar](https://www.seeedstudio.com/) to check.

## Introduction to GPS and GPS Modules

One of the global positioning system (GPS) devices ultilizes data from satellites to locate a specific point on the Earth in a process named trilateration. Meanwhile, a GPS receiver measures the distances to satellites using radio signals to trilaterate. And trilateration is similar to triangulation, which measures angles, depicted in this illustration (Tim Gunther, 2020). GPS modules contain tiny processors and antennas that directly receive data sent by satellites through dedicated RF frequencies. From there, it’ll receive timestamp from each visible satellites, along with other pieces of data. If the module’s antenna can spot 4 or more satellites, it’s able to accurately calculate its position and time.

The four well-known Global Navigation Satellite System include GPS, BDS(Beidou), GLONASS and GALILEO four satellite navigation systems. The earliest appeared in the United States is GPS (Global Positioning System), which is the most complete technology at this stage. BDS, GLONASS and GALILEO have become the other largest satellite navigation systems in the world and are currently in the process of modernization.

We will introduce and compare these two GPS modules:

- [Grove – GPS Module](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GPS/)  
- [Grove – GPS(Air530)](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GPS-Air530/)

These GPS modules are compatible with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making it easy for you to start to try out.The Air 530 Module in **Grove - GPS(Air530)** is a high-performance, highly integrated multi-mode statelite positioning and navigation module. It supports GPS / Beidou / Glonass / Galileo / QZSS / SBAS, which makes it suitable for GNSS positioning applications such as car navigation, smart wear and drone. And Air530 module is also supporting NMEA 0183 V4.1 protocol and compatible with previous versions.

Meanwhile, the E-1612-UB module series of **Grove - GPS Module** is a family of stand-alone GPS receivers featuring the high performance u-blox 5 positioning engine. The 50-channel u-blox 5 positioning engine boasts a Time-To-First-Fix ( TTFF ) of under 1 second. The dedicated acquisition engine, with over 1 million correlators, is capable of massive parallel time / frequency space searches, enabling it to find satellites instantly.

## Operating Principle

You ought to acknowledge the principles of GPS modules before purchasing and the table below is provding some information.

**Personal GPS Assistant**: This project is a device that lets you monitor people and things, and tell you continuously their location, and the values of the sensors attached to it. One of the feature allows you to set limit values for the sensors, and when these are exceeded an SMS alert is sent to you. You can also set restrictions from some places, where alerts will be given to you when the device leaves the area. It’s also possible to communicate with the device through SMS, in order to get information about it.
