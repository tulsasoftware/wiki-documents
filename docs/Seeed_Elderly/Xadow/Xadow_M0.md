## Get Started
---
1.Click this link to signup or login mbed, then import xadow_m0_blinky program into mbed online compiler.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Xadow_M0/img/Import_xadow_m0_blinky.png)

2.On mbed online IDE, click "Compile" (or use CTRL + D) to compile the code and download a binary file.

3.Connect the board to the computer and **long press the button**, a USB drive named **CRP DISABLD** will show up.

4.Delete the **firmware.bin** file in the CRP DISABLD drive, then copy the downloaded file to the drive.

5.**Quick press the button**, the program will be running, an LED will be blinking.

You can open **main.cpp** to change the code. For example, use the following code to blink the LED every 0.1 second.
```
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut blue(P0_20);

int main() {
    while(1) {
        blue = 1;         // Switch ON the LED.
        wait(0.1);        // Wait for 0.1 Seconds.
        blue = 0;         // Switch OFF the LED.
        wait(0.1);        // Wait for 0.1 Seconds.
    }
}
```

## Multifunction for on-board button
---
By default, the on-board button has two functions: quick press to reset, long press to enter ISP mode. We can add more functions!

For example, use [multifunction_for_reset_button](https://developer.mbed.org/users/yihui/code/multifunction_for_reset_button/) to get:
- single click - turn on LED1
- double click - turn on LED2
- long click - reset
- click and then power on - enter ISP mode

## Programming Arch on Windows, Linux or Mac
---
Arch doesn't have an mbed interface. It uses USB In-System-Programming (ISP) to upgrade the firmware.

To enter the USB ISP mode, connect the Arch with your computer and long press its button, and then a disk named "CRP DISABLD" will appear.
- on windows
  1. delete firmware.bin in the "CRP DISABLD" disk.
  2. copy a new firmware into the disk.
- on linux
  1. if the disk is not mounted, mount the disk at {mnt_dir}
  2. **dd if={new_firmware.bin} of={mnt_dir}/firmware.bin conv=notrunc**
- on mac you'll need to use Terminal to run the following script to copy you're .bin file to your Arch
  1. **dd if={new_firmare.bin} of=/Volumes/CRP\ DISABLD/firmware.bin conv=notrunc**

If you're so inclined, you can also create an **Automator** application to support drag-and-drop of the file to your board. Just create a "Run Shell Script" with the following command:
dd if=$* of=/Volumes/CRP\ DISABLD/firmware.bin conv=notrunc

You will also need to change the "Pass Input" option from "to stdin" to "as arguments"--without this you will get an error "The action 'Run Shell Script' encountered an error" or "dd: no value specified for if (1)" in the log.

Also, an improved form of the script is:
- **dd if="${1}" of=/Volumes/CRP\ DISABLD/firmware.bin conv=notrunc**

Which should handle spaces in the file path and only uses the first file supplied.
