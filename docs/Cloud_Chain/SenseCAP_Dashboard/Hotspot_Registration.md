# Hotspot Registration

**How To Register Hotspots With Helium Wallet**
===============================================

*    Please login to the SenseCAP Dashboard by visiting [**https://status.sensecapmx.cloud/**](https://status.sensecapmx.cloud/)
*    Ensure your "Helium APP" is the latest version and login to your Helium wallet.

You can download the latest version by visiting the [**Android Store**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helium.wallet&hl=en_US) or the [**iOS Store**](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1450463605).

*   On the SenseCAP Dashboard, click "Hotspot" on the left menu, then click the blue button that reads "+ Add New Hotspot".

You will then be prompted with a QR code to import your Hotspot from the Helium Wallet as below:

Scan the QR code with your Helium Wallet and grant permission in "**Helium App**" when you are prompted to link wallets.

**Note**: This does NOT give anyone access to your seed phrase to your wallet, this only allows the dashboard to connect and add your hotspot(s) to the dashboard.
