# APP FAQ

**Why do we need to download SenseCAP Hotspot App?**
====================================================

The Original Helium App no longer supports managing manufacturers' Hotspots. SenseCAP Hotspot App can manage SenseCAP MX Hotspot as the Helium App and provides more detailed information and comprehensive functions about your hotspot.

============================================================================

No, SenseCAP App log in with SenseCAP Dashboard account and add Helium wallet by DeepLink to Helium App or enter Helium wallet address.
