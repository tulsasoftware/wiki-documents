<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/sensecraft-edge/overview.png" /></div>

Dashboard Tab is rendering the "node-red-dashboard" view locally on reTerminal DM, here are some design considerations for reference:

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/sensecraft-edge/dashboard-size.png" /></div>

* Maximum width without scrolling: 1075px
* Maximum height without scrolling: 752px

You could also access the dashboard view on the external machine which is on the same network with the reTerminal DM, where you could just open your favorite web browser on that external machine and type in the ip address of your reTerminal DM followed by the default Node-RED port 1880 then followed by **'/ui/'**, which the url should looks like this: **"ipaddress:1880/ui/"**

> For Example: In my case, the ip address of reTerminal DM is "192.168.49.163" then the url is: **"192.168.49.163:1880/ui/"**
