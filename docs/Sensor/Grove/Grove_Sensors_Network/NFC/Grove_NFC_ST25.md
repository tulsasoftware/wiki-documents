Grove - NFC (ST25DV64) is an innovative and versatile NFC/RFID tag board based on the advanced ST25DV64K chip from STMicroelectronics. This dynamic chip supports ISO/IEC 15693 and NFC Forum Type 5 tag standards, making it compatible with a wide array of NFC-enabled devices.

Designed for makers, DIY enthusiasts, and anyone interested in experimenting with NFC technology, the Grove - NFC (ST25DV64) offers a simple, cost-effective solution for adding NFC functionality to your projects. With its open-source nature, you can not only use this board as is but also tweak it to better fit your specific needs, whether you're building a smart home system, a secure access control device, a contactless payment solution, or an inventory tracking system.

The Grove - NFC (ST25DV64) is more than just an NFC tag. It's also a powerful tool that you can use to learn about NFC technology and its applications. With its rich features, you can explore various aspects of NFC, from data transfer and energy harvesting to data protection and general-purpose output.

This board is designed with convenience in mind. It features the standard Grove connector (HY2.0 - 4Pin), making it easily compatible with other Grove modules. Additionally, it works with both 3.3V and 5V systems, making it a flexible solution for your NFC needs.

| SCL           | Yellow                  |

#### Software

- **Step 1.** Download the [ST25DV Arduino Library](https://github.com/limengdu/ST25DV) from Github.

- **Step 2.** Refer to [How to install library](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/How_to_install_Arduino_Library) to install library for Arduino.

- **Step 3.** After downloading and installing the library correctly, you can find an example program named `ST25DV_HelloWorld.ino` in the examples folder. This program is designed for the ST25DV module.

```cpp
#include "ST25DVSensor.h"

#define DEV_I2C         Wire
ST25DV st25dv(12, -1, &DEV_I2C);

void setup() {
  const char uri_write_message[] = "seeedstudio.com";       // Uri message to write in the tag
  const char uri_write_protocol[] = URI_ID_0x01_STRING; // Uri protocol to write in the tag
  String uri_write = String(uri_write_protocol) + String(uri_write_message);
  String uri_read;

  // Initialize serial for output.
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // The wire instance used can be omitted in case you use default Wire instance
  if(st25dv.begin() == 0) {
    Serial.println("System Init done!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("System Init failed!");
    while(1);
  }

  if(st25dv.writeURI(uri_write_protocol, uri_write_message, "")) {
    Serial.println("Write failed!");
    while(1);
  }

  delay(100);
  
  if(st25dv.readURI(&uri_read)) {
    Serial.println("Read failed!");
    while(1);
  }

  Serial.println(uri_read.c_str());

  if(strcmp(uri_read.c_str(), uri_write.c_str()) == 0) {
    Serial.println("Successfully written and read!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Read bad string!");
  }
}

void loop() {  
  //empty loop
} 
```

- **Step 4.** Upload the demo.

- **Step 5.** Open the **Serial Monitor** of Arduino IDE by click **Tool-> Serial Monitor**. You will get below result:

After uploading the provided program to your Arduino, your Grove - NFC (ST25DV64) becomes a fully functioning NFC Tag, which can operate independently. You can remove it from your Arduino board; it doesn't require any additional setup to work.

To test its functionality, you'll need an NFC-enabled smartphone, either Android or Apple. The NFC antenna for this device is located adjacent to the camera. However, if you are unsure about the location of the NFC antenna on your smartphone, it would be beneficial to look it up online.

Place the phone's NFC antenna close to the NFC antenna of the Grove - NFC (ST25DV64). Your smartphone should display a prompt requesting to open a webpage at st.com. This response indicates that your Grove - NFC (ST25DV64) is functioning correctly as an NFC Tag and demonstrates the demo's functionality.
