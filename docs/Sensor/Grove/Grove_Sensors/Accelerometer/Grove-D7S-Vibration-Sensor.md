#### Software

- **Step 1.** Download the [Grove - D7S Vibration Sensor](https://github.com/limengdu/d7s-grove-arduino) from Github.

- **Step 2.** Refer to [How to install library](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/How_to_install_Arduino_Library) to install library for Arduino.

- **Step 3.** After downloading and installing the library correctly, you can find an example program named sample.ino in the examples folder. This program is designed for the D7S module.

```cpp
#include <D7S.h>

//old earthquake data
float oldSI = 0;
float oldPGA = 0;

//flag variables to handle collapse/shutoff only one time during an earthquake
bool shutoffHandled = false;
bool collapseHandled = false;

//function to handle collapse event
void handleCollapse()
{
    //put here the code to handle the collapse event
    Serial.println("-------------------- COLLAPSE! --------------------");
}

void setup()
{
    // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
    Serial.begin(9600);
    while (!Serial)
    {
        ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
    }

    Serial.print("Starting D7S communications (it may take some time)...");
    //start D7S connection
    D7S.begin();
    //wait until the D7S is ready
    while (!D7S.isReady())
    {
        Serial.print(".");
        delay(500);
    }
    Serial.println("STARTED");

    //setting the D7S to switch the axis at inizialization time
    Serial.println("Setting D7S sensor to switch axis at inizialization time.");
    D7S.setAxis(SWITCH_AT_INSTALLATION);

    Serial.println("Initializing the D7S sensor in 2 seconds. Please keep it steady during the initializing process.");
    delay(2000);
    Serial.print("Initializing...");
    //start the initial installation procedure
    D7S.initialize();
    //wait until the D7S is ready (the initializing process is ended)
    while (!D7S.isReady())
    {
        Serial.print(".");
        delay(500);
    }
    Serial.println("INITIALIZED!");

    //check if there there was a collapse (if this is the first time the D7S is put in place the installation data may be wrong)
    if (D7S.isInCollapse())
    {
        handleCollapse();
    }

    //reset the events shutoff/collapse memorized into the D7S
    D7S.resetEvents();

    Serial.println("\nListening for earthquakes!");
}

void loop()
{

    //checking if there is an earthquake occuring right now
    if (D7S.isEarthquakeOccuring())
    {

        //check if the shutoff event has been handled and if the shutoff condition is met
        //the call of D7S.isInShutoff() is executed after to prevent useless I2C call
        if (!collapseHandled && D7S.isInCollapse())
        {
            handleCollapse();
            collapseHandled = true;
        }

        //print information about the current earthquake
        float currentSI = D7S.getInstantaneusSI();
        float currentPGA = D7S.getInstantaneusPGA();

        if (currentSI > oldSI || currentPGA > oldPGA)
        {
            //getting instantaneus SI
            Serial.print("\tInstantaneus SI: ");
            Serial.print(currentSI);
            Serial.println(" [m/s]");

            //getting instantaneus PGA
            Serial.print("\tInstantaneus PGA (Peak Ground Acceleration): ");
            Serial.print(currentPGA);
            Serial.println(" [m/s^2]\n");

            //save the current data
            oldSI = currentSI;
            oldPGA = currentPGA;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        //reset the old earthquake data
        oldPGA = 0;
        oldSI = 0;
        //reset the flag of the handled events
        shutoffHandled = false;
        collapseHandled = false;
        //reset D7S events
        D7S.resetEvents();
    }
}
```

- **Step 4.** Upload the demo. If you do not know how to upload the code, please check [How to upload code](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Upload_Code/).

- **Step 5.** Open the **Serial Monitor** of Arduino IDE by click **Tool-> Serial Monitor**. you can generate some vibrations, for example, by tapping the table, and you will obtain the following results.

:::note
The initialisation of the sensor takes approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
