## Configure Your AWS IoT Service

------------------------------

In this section, we will show how to config the AWS IoT Service:

- Step 1. Create an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?nc1=h_ls).

- Step 2. Go to [AWS IoT](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/home?region=us-west-2#/home).

- Step 3. After you load the IoT console, click on “Get Started”.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/img/Get%20started.png)

- Step 4. Click on “Manage” on the left side menu.and Click on “Register a thing”.
- Step 5. Enter a name, whatever you like, in the original tutorial it was called temperature, then click "create" ("Register a thing" image).

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/img/Register%20a%20thing.png)

- Step 6. Click on the thing that you create.
- Step 7. Click on Security on the left menu and click on Create certificate.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/img/Thing%20-%20Security.png)

- Step 8. It will show three download links which are correspond to different key files or certificate. Download these file, we need them later. Also make sure to download the root CA (above the "Activate" button"). Click on Activate and then click on Attach a policy and then on Create a policy.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/img/Certificate%20created.png)

- Step 9. Name your policy however you want, we named our policy1. To start, you can use iot:*as the Action and*as the Resource ARN. Check mark Allow and click create.
For future reference, the * for actions and resource ARN allows you to do all actions on all devices. The best practice for production policies is to make them more specific.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/img/Create%20a%20policy.png)

- Step 10. Now that the policy has been created, click on Certificates on the left side.
Click on the certificate we previously created.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/img/Certificates.png)

- Step 11. Click on the Actions button and pick Attach policy from the menu.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Cloud_and_Grove_IoT_Starter_Kit_Powered_by_AWS/img/Certificate%20Actions.png)
