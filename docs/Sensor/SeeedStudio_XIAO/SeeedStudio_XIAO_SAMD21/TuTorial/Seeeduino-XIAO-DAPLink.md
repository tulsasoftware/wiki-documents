# Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD 21 DAPLink

Now, we have **developed the DAPLink firmware running on your Arduino Boards**(*SAMD Series*) such as [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) and [Seeeduino Xiao](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html) so that you can upload and debug development boards that support DAPLink in a most cost-effective way!

## Features

- Debug and Flash Arm Cortex CPUs
- Provides a virtual serial port, eliminating the need for a usb to serial port
- Drag and drop to upload firmware(coming soon)

## Get Started

Please visit the Arduino DAPLink Get Started Wiki here.

### `uf2` Method

For convenience, we also provide `uf2` methods of uploading Wio Terminal's firmware. Simply download the `uf2` files from below.

- Download the [**simple_daplink_xiao**](http://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino-XIAO/res/simple_daplink_xiao.uf2) `uf2` files.

Entering the bootloader mode by sliding the power switch twice quickly. For more reference, please also see [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Getting-Started/#faq).

An external drive named `Arduino` should appear in your PC. Drag the the downloaded uf2 files to the `Arduino` drive.
