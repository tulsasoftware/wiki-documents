### 0. Standard XIAO Pads

These are the standard pads for connecting the XIAO microcontroller.

### 1. J1 Pads

The J1 pads allow users to decide whether to connect the MCP23017's RST, INTB, and INTA pins to the XIAO's D6, D1, and D0 pins through soldering. From top to bottom, they are RST, INTB, INTA.

By default, when you use the Expansion Board, the Additional Output Pads in area 8 are enabled. If you don't want to enable them, you need to cut the two adjacent pads in area J1 with a knife.

### 2. MCP23017 Chip

This is the main I/O expander chip, providing an additional 16 IOs.

### 3. J2 Pads

This pad is for selecting the I2C address. The default address is 0x21. If you solder this pad, the address can be changed to 0x20.

### 4. MCP23017 Output Pins

These are the output pins from the MCP23017 chip. Each pin's definition can be seen on the back of the board. They range from PA0 to PB7, providing a total of 16 IOs.

### 5. Grove Pads

If you wish to connect a Grove module, you can solder the provided Grove socket. This Grove interface is connected to the I2C bus. If you choose to use the IIC pins here, then you will not be able to use the extended IO pins in area 4.

### 6. VCC Pin

This is an output pin that can be used to power other components.

### 7. GND Pin

This is also an output pin that can be used for grounding other components.

### 8. Additional Output Pads

These are some additional output pads, including GND, INTB, INTA, RST. If you wish to solder these pins for use elsewhere, you can do so.


## Getting Started

Welcome to the quick start guide for the IO Expander for XIAO. This guide aims to help you set up and get started with your new IO Expander board in conjunction with the XIAO RP2040 main controller.

### Hardware Preparation

Upon receiving your product, some soldering will be required. We've provided two pin headers with the package. You'll need to solder these headers onto the expansion board. 

Once the soldering is complete, you can proceed to connect the expansion board to the XIAO RP2040 main controller.


For programming the XIAO RP2040, you'll need a TYPE-C USB data cable. Connect one end to the XIAO RP2040 and the other to your computer. For a detailed guide on programming the XIAO RP2040, please refer to this [Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040/).

### Software Preparation

Before you can start programming the board, you'll need a specific library for XIAO. Download the MCP23017 library from this [GitHub link](https://github.com/limengdu/Adafruit-MCP23017-Arduino-Library). Once downloaded, install the library in your programming environment.

## Demo: IO output high and low level

In the Arduino IDE, open a new sketch and copy the following example code:

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_MCP23X17.h>

Adafruit_MCP23X17 mcp;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    Serial.println("MCP23xxx Blink Test!");
    if (!mcp.begin_I2C()) {
        Serial.println("Error.");
        while (1);
    }

    Serial.println("Looping...");

    for(int i=0; i<16; i++) {
        mcp.pinMode(i, OUTPUT);
    }
}

void loop() {
    mcp.digitalWrite(15, LOW); //PB7
    mcp.digitalWrite(14, HIGH); //PB6
    mcp.digitalWrite(13, HIGH); //PB5
    mcp.digitalWrite(12, HIGH); //PB4
    mcp.digitalWrite(11, HIGH); //PB3
    mcp.digitalWrite(10, HIGH); //PB2
    mcp.digitalWrite(9, HIGH); //PB1
    mcp.digitalWrite(8, HIGH); //PB0
    mcp.digitalWrite(7, HIGH); //PA7
    mcp.digitalWrite(6, HIGH); //PA6
    mcp.digitalWrite(5, HIGH); //PA5
    mcp.digitalWrite(4, HIGH); //PA4
    mcp.digitalWrite(3, HIGH); //PA3
    mcp.digitalWrite(2, HIGH); //PA2
    mcp.digitalWrite(1, HIGH); //PA1
    mcp.digitalWrite(0, HIGH); //PA0
    delay(1000);
}
```

Upload the above code to your XIAO. After the code is successfully uploaded, you will see that all pins are 3.3V high except for the PB7 pin.

:::caution
This expansion board can only use digital inputs and outputs, not PWM or analog input and output functions.

### Pin Addressing

When using single pin operations such as _pinMode(pinId, dir)_ or _digitalRead(pinId)_  or _digitalWrite(pinId, val)_ then the pins are addressed using the ID's below. For example, for set the mode of _GPB0_ then use _pinMode(8, ...)_. **NOTE** The MCP23008 and MCP23S08 only have _GPAx_ pins.

| MCP23x17 Pin # | Pin Name | Pin ID |
| :------------: | :------: | :----: |
|       21       |   GPA0   |   0    |
|       22       |   GPA1   |   1    |
|       23       |   GPA2   |   2    |
|       24       |   GPA3   |   3    |
|       25       |   GPA4   |   4    |
|       26       |   GPA5   |   5    |
|       27       |   GPA6   |   6    |
|       28       |   GPA7   |   7    |
|       1        |   GPB0   |   8    |
|       2        |   GPB1   |   9    |
|       3        |   GPB2   |   10   |
|       4        |   GPB3   |   11   |
|       5        |   GPB4   |   12   |
|       6        |   GPB5   |   13   |
|       7        |   GPB6   |   14   |
|       8        |   GPB7   |   15   |


## FAQ

### 1. Why isn't my IO Expander for XIAO responding?

**Answer**: Ensure that the XIAO module is correctly plugged into the expansion board. Also, check if the necessary libraries are installed and the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.

### 2. Can I use the IO Expander for XIAO with other microcontrollers?

**Answer**: Yes, the IO Expander is designed primarily for the XIAO module, but it can be used with other microcontrollers that support I2C communication. You might need to adjust the code and connections accordingly.

### 3. How do I change the I2C address of the MCP23017 chip on the IO Expander for XIAO?

**Answer**: The default I2C address is set to 0x21. If you want to change it to 0x20, there's a jumper labeled "J2" on the board. You'll need to solder the J2 jumper to change the address.

### 4. I'm getting noise or erratic behavior on my IO pins. What could be the cause?

**Answer**: Ensure that the connections are secure and there's no interference. Using pull-up or pull-down resistors can help stabilize the input pins. Also, ensure that the power supply is stable and can provide the necessary current for all connected devices.
