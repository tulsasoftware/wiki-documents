The Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 is an embedded development board that boasts outstanding RF performance, thanks to its support for both 2.4GHz Wifi - 802.11b/g/n and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) dual wireless communication. This capability enables the XIAO ESP32S3 to provide reliable and high-speed wireless connectivity for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In addition, the board supports U.FL antenna connection, which can extend the communication range to over 100 meters, making it an ideal choice for projects that require long-range wireless connectivity. In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage the XIAO ESP32S3's Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to a Wi-Fi network and perform basic networking tasks.

## Getting Started

### Installation of antenna

On the bottom left of the front of XIAO ESP32S3, there is a separate "WiFi/BT Antenna Connector". In order to get better WiFi/Bluetooth signal, you need to take out the antenna inside the package and install it on the connector.

There is a little trick to the installation of the antenna, if you press down hard on it directly, you will find it very difficult to press and your fingers will hurt! The correct way to install the antenna is to put one side of the antenna connector into the connector block first, then press down a little on the other side, and the antenna will be installed.

Remove the antenna is also the case, do not use brute force to pull the antenna directly, one side of the force to lift, the antenna is easy to take off.

:::note
If the antenna is not installed, it may not be able to connect to the WiFi network.

If you have the conditions, I suggest you use the big stick antenna, which will get a better experience.

## The commonly interfaces of WiFi library

ESP32-S3 provides a wide range of WiFi network functions. Generally, we can see the functions of the WiFi library in the ESP32's built-in package and choose the corresponding function to achieve the desired functionality. Next, we will list some commonly used interfaces and introduce their usage.

### Generic WiFi function

- `WiFiGenericClass::getHostname()` -- Is a function in the WiFi library for ESP32 that returns the hostname of the device as a string. The hostname is a unique name that identifies the device on the network. This function retrieves the hostname that was previously set using `WiFiGenericClass::setHostname()`. If no hostname has been set, the default hostname will be returned.

- `WiFiGenericClass::persistent(bool persistent)` -- Is a method that is used to enable or disable the persistent mode of the ESP32 WiFi library. When persistent mode is enabled, the Wi-Fi configuration is stored in non-volatile memory (NVM) and is retained even after a power cycle or reset. When persistent mode is disabled, the configuration is stored in RAM and is lost after a power cycle or reset.

	- **Input Parameters**
		- **persistent**: If the argument is true, persistent mode is enabled. If the argument is false, persistent mode is disabled.

- `WiFiGenericClass::enableLongRange(bool enable)` -- The function is used to enable or disable the Long Range (LR) feature of the WiFi module. When enabled, the LR feature allows the module to connect to WiFi networks that are further away than usual, but with lower data rates.

	- **Input Parameters**
		- **enable**: The parameter should be set to true to enable the feature and false to disable it.

- `WiFiGenericClass::mode(wifi_mode_t m)` -- The function is used to set the WiFi mode of the device.

	- **Input Parameters**
		- **m**: The m parameter specifies the mode to set, which can be one of the following constants defined in the wifi_mode_t enum:
			- **WIFI_MODE_NULL**: Disables both WiFi station and access point modes.
			- **WIFI_MODE_STA**: Enables WiFi station mode to connect to an existing WiFi network.
			- **WIFI_MODE_AP**: Enables access point mode to create a new WiFi network.
			- **WIFI_MODE_APSTA**: Enables both WiFi station and access point modes.

- `WiFiGenericClass::setSleep(wifi_ps_type_t sleepType)` -- The function sets the power-saving mode for the WiFi module.

	- **Input Parameters**
		- **sleepType**: The sleepType parameter is an enumerated type that specifies the type of power-saving mode to use. There are three possible sleep types:
			- **WIFI_PS_NONE**: This is the default sleep mode, in which the WiFi module does not go into power-saving mode.
			- **WIFI_PS_MIN_MODEM**: In this mode, the WiFi module shuts down its modem while maintaining the connection to the access point (AP).
			- **WIFI_PS_MAX_MODEM**: In this mode, the WiFi module shuts down both the modem and the station, which results in a disconnection from the AP.

- `WiFiClient::available()` -- The function is used to check how many bytes of data are available to be read from the server.

	- **Output**: It returns an integer value representing the number of bytes available to be read.

### WiFi Server function

- `WiFiServer::stopAll()` -- This function is a method of the WiFiServer class in the Arduino WiFi library. This method stops all server instances that are created using the WiFiServer class. It is useful when you want to stop all servers at once instead of calling `stop()` method for each instance individually.

- `WiFiServer::begin(uint16_t port, int enable)` -- The function is used to start a server on the specified port. The server will listen for incoming client connections.

	- **Input Parameters**

	- **Output**: True/False


- `WiFiMulti::run(uint32_t connectTimeout)` -- The function attempts to connect to one of the saved access points in a sequential order until it successfully connects to one.

	- **Input Parameters**
		- **connectTimeout**: The parameter specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for a connection in milliseconds. If connectTimeout is set to 0, the function will not time out and will attempt to connect indefinitely.

	- **Output**: status

## Scan nearby WiFi networks

The following is a sample program that uses the XIAO ESP32S3 to scan for nearby WiFi networks.

In your Arduino IDE, go to **File > Examples > WiFi > WiFiScan**. This will load a sketch that scans WiFi networks within the range of your XIAO ESP32S3.

This can be useful to check if the WiFi network you‚Äôre trying to connect is within the range of your board or other applications. Your WiFi project may not often work because it may not be able to connect to your router due to insufficient WiFi strength.

```c
#include "WiFi.h"

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Set WiFi to station mode and disconnect from an AP if it was previously connected
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.disconnect();
  delay(100);

  Serial.println("Setup done");
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("scan start");

  // WiFi.scanNetworks will return the number of networks found
  int n = WiFi.scanNetworks();
  Serial.println("scan done");
  if (n == 0) {
      Serial.println("no networks found");
  } else {
    Serial.print(n);
    Serial.println(" networks found");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      // Print SSID and RSSI for each network found
      Serial.print(i + 1);
      Serial.print(": ");
      Serial.print(WiFi.SSID(i));
      Serial.print(" (");
      Serial.print(WiFi.RSSI(i));
      Serial.print(")");
      Serial.println((WiFi.encryptionType(i) == WIFI_AUTH_OPEN)?" ":"*");
      delay(10);
    }
  }
  Serial.println("");

  // Wait a bit before scanning again
  delay(5000);
}
```

Upload and run the program, and you should see the serial monitor print out the nearby WiFi networks that can be searched by the XIAO ESP32S3.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/37.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Program annotation

The first thing you need to do to use the XIAO ESP32S3 WiFi functionalities is to include the **WiFi.h** library in your code, as follows:

```c
#include <WiFi.h>
```

The XIAO ESP32S3 can act as WiFi Station, Access Point or both. To set the WiFi mode, use `WiFi.mode()` and set the desired mode as argument.

```c
WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
```

When the ESP32 is set as a Wi-Fi station, it can connect to other networks (like your router).

`WiFi.scanNetworks()` returns the number of networks found. After the scanning, you can access the parameters about each network. `WiFi.SSID()` prints the SSID for a specific network.

`WiFi.RSSI()` returns the RSSI of that network. RSSI stands for Received Signal Strength Indicator. It is an estimated measure of power level that an RF client device is receiving from an access point or router.

Finally, `WiFi.encryptionType()` returns the network encryption type. That specific example puts a * in the case of open networks. However, that function can return one of the following options (not just open networks):
- WIFI_AUTH_OPEN
- WIFI_AUTH_WEP
- WIFI_AUTH_WPA_PSK
- WIFI_AUTH_WPA2_PSK
- WIFI_AUTH_WPA_WPA2_PSK
- WIFI_AUTH_WPA2_ENTERPRISE

## Connect to a WiFi network

To connect the ESP32 to a specific Wi-Fi network, you must know its SSID and password. Additionally, that network must be within the ESP32 WiFi range (to check that, you can use the previous example to scan WiFi networks).

The following is an example of using the XIAO ESP32S3 to connect to a specified network. Where the function `initWiFi()` plays the role of connecting to the network in the program.

```c
#include "WiFi.h"

// Replace with your network credentials
const char* ssid = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD";

void initWiFi() {
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  Serial.print("Connecting to WiFi ..");
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.print('.');
    delay(1000);
  }
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Set WiFi to station mode and disconnect from an AP if it was previously connected
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.disconnect();
  delay(100);

  initWiFi();
}

void loop() {
  
}
```

Upload and run the program to open the serial monitor. When connecting to the network, the serial monitor will print a string of dots until the connection is successful, then the IP address of the XIAO will be printed.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/38.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Program annotation

Let‚Äôs take a quick look on how this function works.

First, set the WiFi mode. If the XIAO ESP32S3 will connected to another network (access point/hotspot) it must be in station mode.

```c
WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
```

Then, use `WiFi.begin()` to connect to a network. You must pass as arguments the network SSID and its password:

```c
WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
```

Connecting to a WiFi network can take a while, so we usually add a while loop that keeps checking if the connection was already established by using `WiFi.status()`. When the connection is successfully established, it returns `WL_CONNECTED`.

If you want to get the WiFi connection strength, you can simply call `WiFi.RSSI()` after a WiFi connection.

## softAP Usage

If you set the XIAO ESP32S3 as an access point (hotspot), you can be connected to the ESP32 using any device with WiFi capabilities without the need to connect to your router.

In simple words, when you set the XIAO ESP32S3 as an access point you create its own WiFi network and nearby WiFi devices (stations) can connect to it (like your smartphone or your computer).

In your Arduino IDE, go to **File > Examples > WiFi > WiFiAccessPoint**. This example will show you how to use XIAO ESP32S3 to create a hotspot and control the on/off switch of a light through a simple web page connected to the hotspot.

:::note
1. We made some minor changes to the sample program by commenting out LED_BUILTIN, because the XIAO ESP32S3 has its own user indicator and we don't need an external LED.
2. The LED will only turn off when the user LED pin on the XIAO ESP32S3 is set to a high level, and it will only turn on when the pin is set to a low level.
3. You also need to modify the hotspot name and password in the program to your desired ones.

```c
/*
  WiFiAccessPoint.ino creates a WiFi access point and provides a web server on it.

  Steps:
  1. Connect to the access point "yourAp"
  2. Point your web browser to http://192.168.4.1/H to turn the LED on or http://192.168.4.1/L to turn it off
     OR
     Run raw TCP "GET /H" and "GET /L" on PuTTY terminal with 192.168.4.1 as IP address and 80 as port

After uploading and running the program, XIAO ESP32S3 will create a hotspot named "XIAO_ESP32S3". You can connect to this network using your computer or phone, with the password "password". Then, open "192.168.4.1" in a browser to access the web page that controls the LED switch.

### Program annotation

There‚Äôs a section in the `setup()` to set the ESP32 as an access point using the `softAP()` method:

```c
WiFi.softAP(ssid, password);
```

Next, we need to get the access point IP address using the softAPIP() method and print it in the Serial Monitor.

```c
IPAddress myIP = WiFi.softAPIP();
Serial.print("AP IP address: ");
Serial.println(myIP);
server.begin();
```

These are the snippets of code you need to include in your web server sketches to set the XIAO ESP32S3 as an access point.

## WiFi & MQTT Usage

The XIAO ESP32S3 is a powerful motherboard that supports the MQTT protocol, making it an excellent choice for IoT projects that require reliable and efficient communication between devices.

```c
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>

// Replace with your network credentials
const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";

// MQTT broker IP address
const char* mqtt_server = "test.mosquitto.org";

// Initialize the WiFi and MQTT client objects
WiFiClient espClient;
PubSubClient client(espClient);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Connect to WiFi network
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  }

  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");

  // Set the MQTT broker server IP address and port
  client.setServer(mqtt_server, 1883);

  // Connect to MQTT broker
  while (!client.connected()) {
    if (client.connect("ESP32Client")) {
      Serial.println("Connected to MQTT broker");
    } else {
      Serial.print("Failed to connect to MQTT broker, rc=");
      Serial.print(client.state());
      Serial.println(" retrying in 5 seconds");
      delay(5000);
    }
  }

  // Subscribe to MQTT topic
  client.subscribe("test/topic");
}

void loop() {
  // Check if the MQTT client is connected
  if (!client.connected()) {
    // Reconnect to MQTT broker
    if (client.connect("ESP32Client")) {
      Serial.println("Connected to MQTT broker");
      // Subscribe to MQTT topic after reconnection
      client.subscribe("test/topic");
    }
  }

  // Handle MQTT messages
  client.loop();

  // Publish a message to the MQTT broker
  client.publish("test/topic", "Hello from XIAO ESP32S3");
  delay(5000);
}
```

In this example program, XIAO ESP32S3 connects to the network via WiFi and connects to a specified MQTT broker, subscribes to the topic **test/topic**, and publishes a message to the topic every 5 seconds. 

When XIAO ESP32S3 receives a message from the MQTT broker, it can be processed in the `client.onMessage` callback function. You need to replace the variables `ssid`, `password`, `mqtt_server`, etc. in the example program with your own network and MQTT server information.

## WiFi Mesh

Accordingly to the [Espressif documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/mesh.html):

"ESP-MESH is a networking protocol built atop the Wi-Fi protocol. ESP-MESH allows numerous devices (referred to as nodes) spread over a large physical area (both indoors and outdoors) to be interconnected under a single WLAN (Wireless Local-Area Network). ESP-MESH is self-organizing and self-healing meaning the network can be built and maintained autonomously."

In a traditional Wi-Fi network architecture, a single node (access point ‚Äì usually the router) is connected to all other nodes (stations). Each node can communicate with each other using the access point. However, this is limited to the access point wi-fi coverage. Every station must be in the range to connect directly to the access point.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/42.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

With ESP-MESH, the nodes don‚Äôt need to connect to a central node. Nodes are responsible for relaying each others transmissions. This allows multiple devices to spread over a large physical area. The Nodes can self-organize and dynamically talk to each other to ensure that the packet reaches its final node destination. If any node is removed from the network, it is able to self-organize to make sure that the packets reach their destination.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/43.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The [painlessMesh library](https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh) allows us to create a mesh network with the ESP32 boards in an easy way.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/44.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If a window pops up prompting us to download some dependent packages to use this library, we also need to download them together.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/45.png" style={{width:500, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If this window doesn‚Äôt show up, you‚Äôll need to install the following library dependencies:

- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) (by bblanchon)
- [TaskScheduler](https://github.com/arkhipenko/TaskScheduler)
- [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP) (ESP32)

To get started with ESP-MESH, we‚Äôll first experiment with the library‚Äôs basic example. This example creates a mesh network in which all boards broadcast messages to all the other boards.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/46.png" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Before uploading the code, you can set up the `MESH_PREFIX` (it‚Äôs like the name of the MESH network) and the `MESH_PASSWORD` variables (you can set it to whatever you like).

Then, we recommend that you change the following line for each board to easily identify the node that sent the message. For example, for node 1, change the message as follows:

```c
String msg = "Hi from node 1 ";
```

Okay, next we will use two XIAO ESP32S3 as an example. The conceptual diagram after networking is roughly as follows.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/47.png" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Upload the program separately to the two XIAO, open the serial port monitor and set the baud rate to 115200. (If there are two XIAO, you may need additional serial port software), if the program runs smoothly, you will see the following results:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SeeedStudio-XIAO-ESP32S3/img/48.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Program annotation

Start by including the painlessMesh library. Then, add the mesh details. The `MESH_PREFIX` refers to the name of the mesh. The `MESH_PASSWORD`, as the name suggests is the mesh password. All nodes in the mesh should use the same `MESH_PREFIX` and `MESH_PASSWORD`. The `MESH_PORT` refers to the the TCP port that you want the mesh server to run on. The default is **5555**.

It is recommended to avoid using `delay()` in the mesh network code. To maintain the mesh, some tasks need to be performed in the background. Using `delay()` will stop these tasks from happening and can cause the mesh to lose stability/fall apart. Instead, it is recommended to use `TaskScheduler` to run your tasks which is used in painlessMesh itself. The following line creates a new `Scheduler` called `userScheduler`.

```c
Scheduler userScheduler; // to control your personal task
```

Create a `painlessMesh` object called mesh to handle the mesh network.

```c
painlessMesh  mesh;
```

Create a task called `taskSendMessage` responsible for calling the `sendMessage()` function every second as long as the program is running.

```c
Task taskSendMessage(TASK_SECOND * 1 , TASK_FOREVER, &sendMessage);
```

The `sendMessage()` function sends a message to all nodes in the message network (broadcast).

```c
void sendMessage() {
  String msg = "Hello from node 1";
  msg += mesh.getNodeId();
  mesh.sendBroadcast( msg );
  taskSendMessage.setInterval(random(TASK_SECOND * 1, TASK_SECOND * 5));
}
```

The message contains the ‚ÄúHello from node 1‚Äù text followed by the board chip ID.

To broadcast a message, simply use the `sendBroadcast()` method on the mesh object and pass as argument the message (msg) you want to send.

```c
mesh.sendBroadcast(msg);
```

Every time a new message is sent, the code changes the interval between messages (one to five seconds).

```c
taskSendMessage.setInterval(random(TASK_SECOND * 1, TASK_SECOND * 5));
```

Next, several callback functions are created that will be called when specific events happen on the mesh. The `receivedCallback()` function prints the message sender (from) and the content of the message (`msg.c_str()`).

```c
void receivedCallback( uint32_t from, String &msg ) {
  Serial.printf("startHere: Received from %u msg=%s\n", from, msg.c_str());
}
```

The `newConnectionCallback()` function runs whenever a new node joins the network. This function simply prints the chip ID of the new node. You can modify the function to do any other task.

```c
void newConnectionCallback(uint32_t nodeId) {
  Serial.printf("--> startHere: New Connection, nodeId = %u\n", nodeId);
}
```

The `changedConnectionCallback()` function runs whenever a connection changes on the network (when a node joins or leaves the network).

```c
void changedConnectionCallback() {
  Serial.printf("Changed connections\n");
}
```

The `nodeTimeAdjustedCallback()` function runs when the network adjusts the time, so that all nodes are synchronized. It prints the offset.

```c
void nodeTimeAdjustedCallback(int32_t offset) {
  Serial.printf("Adjusted time %u. Offset = %d\n", mesh.getNodeTime(),offset);
}
```

In the `setup()`, initialize the serial monitor. Choose the desired debug message types:

```c
//mesh.setDebugMsgTypes( ERROR | MESH_STATUS | CONNECTION | SYNC | COMMUNICATION | GENERAL | MSG_TYPES | REMOTE ); // all types on

mesh.setDebugMsgTypes( ERROR | STARTUP );  // set before init() so that you can see startup messages
```

Initialize the mesh with the details defined earlier.

```c
mesh.init(MESH_PREFIX, MESH_PASSWORD, &userScheduler, MESH_PORT);
```

Assign all the callback functions to their corresponding events.

```c
mesh.onReceive(&receivedCallback);
mesh.onNewConnection(&newConnectionCallback);
mesh.onChangedConnections(&changedConnectionCallback);
mesh.onNodeTimeAdjusted(&nodeTimeAdjustedCallback);
```

Finally, add the taskSendMessage function to the userScheduler. The scheduler is responsible for handling and running the tasks at the right time.

```c
userScheduler.addTask(taskSendMessage);
```

Finally, enable the taskSendMessage, so that the program starts sending the messages to the mesh.

```c
taskSendMessage.enable();
```

To keep the mesh running, add `mesh.update()` to the `loop()`.

```c
void loop() {
  // it will run the user scheduler as well
  mesh.update();
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: Why can't I connect to the XIAO ESP32S3 hotspot when I am using the softAP example?

This may be caused by insufficient antenna strength of XIAO ESP32S3 or overheating of XIAO ESP32S3. After testing, the XIAO ESP32S3's chip can reach a maximum temperature of 50 degrees Celsius when using this example. This may lead to network abnormalities if run for a long time. At this time, you can cool down and retry again.

If the cause of overheating is ruled out, then it is possible that the antenna signal is the cause of the problem. The strength of the included antenna cannot support high-intensity network work in general, so you can purchase a suitable stick antenna to use if needed.
