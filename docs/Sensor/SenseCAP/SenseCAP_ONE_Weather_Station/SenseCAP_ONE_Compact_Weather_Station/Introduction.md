## Product Introduction

Today, data on localized weather, known as microclimates, is the new frontier for more precise and accurate weather forecasting. As a result, the collection of weather data is becoming increasingly smaller and gridded. In light of this, weather stations, which are the most convenient means of collecting weather data, are seeing a rise in demand.

SenseCAP ONE compact weather stations consist of several meteorological sensors that measure the following parameters: air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, light intensity, rainfall, PM2.5, PM10, wind speed, wind direction, and CO2. By adopting a modular design, SenseCAP ONE makes it possible for you to conveniently integrate different combinations of sensors into one compact weather station according to your actual application needs.


## Features

- **Multiple weather parameters to measure in one**: air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, light intensity, rainfall, PM2.5, PM10, wind speed, wind direction, and CO2.

- **Embedded with the electronic compass/magnetometer**: enabling easy installation and you can choose to disable the electronic compass while orienting to the North manually.

- **Powerful Components Included**: A 3m cable for the pole mount; integrated heaters that can be switched on in extreme weather; radiation shields are equipped to ensure accurate ambient measurement; ultrasonic wind speed & direction sensors without moving parts; optical rain gauge that is compact in size and user-friendly3m cable is included in the package for the pole mount

- **Industrial-level design: IP66 rated**: waterproof, and dustproof, suitable for outdoor scenarios

- **Supported interface**: RS485 (MODBUS-RTU) / SDI-12
In line with International Standards: CE and FCC certified.
