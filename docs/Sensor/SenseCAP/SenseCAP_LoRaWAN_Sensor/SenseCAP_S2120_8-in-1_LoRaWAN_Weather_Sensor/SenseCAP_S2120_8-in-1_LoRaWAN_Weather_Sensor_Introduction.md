[![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/wiki%20images/S2120%20Introduction.files/Introduction146.png)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/sensecap-s2120-lorawan-8-in-1-weather-sensor-p-5436.html)

SenseCAP S2120 battery-powered 8-in-1 LoRaWAN weather sensor measures
air temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, light
intensity, UV index, and barometric pressure. It enables low maintenance
cost for its ultra-low power consumption, reliable performance, built-in
Bluetooth, and app service for OTA configuration and remote device
management. It supports multi-scenario applications like
backyard, gardens, smart agriculture, meteorology, smart city, etc.
SenseCAP S21XX is compatible with LoRaWAN® V1.0.3 protocol and can work
with [LoRaWAN® gateway](https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRaWAN-Gateway-c-1936.html).

LoRaWAN® gateways can provide LoRaWAN® network coverage which is
required when using such sensors. S210X can be connected to different
LoRaWAN® gateways while what Seeed provides offers you a seamless user
experience.

Helium Network: Sensors work in areas covered by Helium Network (Check
on [Helium Explorer](https://explorer.helium.com/)). You can check the [SenseCAP
M1](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-M1-LoRaWAN-Indoor-Gateway-US915-p-5023.html) and [SenseCAP M2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-M2-Data-Only-LoRaWAN-Indoor-Gateway-SX1302-US915-p-5342.html).

LoRaWAN Network: Sensors work in LoRaWAN® networks, like The Things
Network, Loriot, Chirpstack, etc. You can check the [SenseCAP Outdoor
Gateway](https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRaWAN-Gateway-US915-p-4306.html) and the [SenseCAP M2 Multiplatform
Gateway](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Multi-Platform-LoRaWAN-Indoor-Gateway-SX1302-US915-p-5472.html).

# Application

-   Backyard and Garden: Measure air temperature and humidity, rainfall,
    UV index, etc. in the backyard and garden to protect your family.

-   Smart Agriculture: Enable farmers to obtain climate data and
    information in time, take scientific management measures into
    production, and improve agricultural production capacity and level.

-   Meteorology: Support applications in the professional meteorological
    field, for example, timely reflects the changes of various abnormal
    meteorological conditions in the field of traffic and transportation
    to provide real-time scientific basis data for traffic management
    departments.

-   Urban Weather: Provide real-time data for urban squares, parks,
    scenic spots, golf courses, and other urban areas.

# LoRaWAN Frequency

*Note: No Frequency limitation. Weather stations can be switched to
other frequency plans at any time.*

*S2120 is manufactured to support the universal frequency plan from
863MHz \~928MHz in one SKU. That is to say, it can support the frequency
plans below:*

|Frequency Plan|Common Name|Sub-band|
| :- | :- | :- |
|EU863-870|EU868|\_\_\_|
|US902-928|US915|Sub-band from 1 to 8|
|AU915-928|AU915|Sub-band from 1 to 8|
|AS923|AS923|AS923\_1, AS923\_2, AS923\_3, AS923\_4|
|IN865-867|IN865|\_\_\_|
|KR920-923|KR920|\_\_\_|
|RU864-867|RU864|\_\_\_|

The frequency plan setting is none by default and it will not transmit
RF signal until it has been set by App via Bluetooth at the first
power-up. And it can be changed to other frequency plans at any time.
