Micro hydro power is clean, renewable energy. Here is a G 1/2 micro hydro generator which can supply stably output voltage and output current with the help of one voltage stabilizing circuit and one rechargeable battery. We can install it at home to save household energy, like using spray shower to light LEDs etc.
