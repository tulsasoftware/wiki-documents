This is a simple but very useful capacitance meter. New version fixed design errors in previous version and came with several improvements:

*   Improved PCB layout.
*   Added popular DC jack for easy connection of power supply.
*   Added switch. This is desirable when running on battery.
*   Added mounting holes.
*   Polarity marked out.
*   Smaller size.
