SDLogger is a simple serial logger based on [SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com/)/[Nathan Seidle's OpenLog](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog/wiki/). It is using an ATmega644P processor running at 14.7456MHz and logs to full-size SD cards. It supports both standard SD cards (FAT16) and SDHC cards (FAT32). SDLogger ships with OpenLog firmware 1.61 installed (compiled with SDHC/FAT32 support and large 2048 character input buffer) together with an Arduino-compatible bootloader for easy program update.
