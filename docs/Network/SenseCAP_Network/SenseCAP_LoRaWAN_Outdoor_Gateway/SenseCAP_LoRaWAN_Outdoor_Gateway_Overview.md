### Description


SenseCAP Gateway - LoRaWAN is based on LoRaWAN protocol, applicable for low-power consumption, long-range environmental data collection, and remote monitoring scenarios such as smart agriculture and smart city.

As the central device of SenseCAP LoRaWAN network, the gateway is used for collecting data from different [SenseCAP Sensors](https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=SenseCAP+Sensor "SenseCAP Sensor") and transmitting the data to the cloud platform via cellular LTE or Ethernet. Equipped with a high-performance processor AM3358 and telecom operator-level Long Range chip SX1301, this device ensures robustness and high performance in large-scale networks. Mutual authentication and encryption are established in the whole network to increase security.

The gateway is designed with an IP66 enclosure and supports an extended operating temperature range, making it suitable for industrial applications in both indoor and outdoor severe environments.

The Gateway can be set up easily out of the box. Users can bind and manage the device through **SenseCAP Mate APP** and **[SenseCAP Portal](https://sensecap-docs.seeed.cc/quickstart.html)** in 4 steps. After that, users can start configuring the sensors in the same way to create the LoRaWAN® network solutions.

1.  Scan the QR code for device binding
2.  Connect gateway to internet and power on
3.  Device deployment
4.  Connect sensors to the network and upload data to the cloud
