## What is Docker ?

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/docker.png" alt="pir" width="200" height="auto"/></p>

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated containers. Containers are self-contained units that package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. Docker simplifies the process of creating, distributing, and running applications, making it easier to develop and deploy software in a consistent and reproducible manner. With Docker, developers can encapsulate their applications and ensure that they run smoothly across different operating systems and infrastructure setups, making it an invaluable tool for building portable and scalable applications, streamlining development workflows, and enabling efficient collaboration among team members.

## What is Portainer ?

## Set up the Docker environment on the LinkStar OpenWRT router.

By default, the Docker installation on LinkStar has a storage capacity of around 250MB, which may not be sufficient for installing images. Therefore, we need to allocate more space to Docker to accommodate our requirements. As same as [Plex media server WiKi](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/plex_media_server/) you need to follow steps.If you have already done it, please skip this step.

**Note:** For that make sure to follow the [Set up the docker environment on the linkstar openwrt router](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/plex_media_server/#set-up-the-docker-environment-on-the-linkstar-openwrt-router) before going through this guide.

## Install Portainer container

### Step 1: Open Putty and SSH to OpenWrt Terminal

To begin the installation process, open Putty and establish an SSH connection to the OpenWrt terminal. Enter the following details:

:::note

Username: root

Password: password

### Step 2: Install Portainer

For that use this command.

```sh
docker pull portainer/portainer
``` 
Next type the following command in the terminal

```sh
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name portainer --restart always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer

Below, you will find the docker-compose.yml script for WordPress. This file plays a crucial role in defining and configuring the WordPress application within a Docker environment. It allows you to specify a range of parameters, including container images, environment variables, network settings, volume mappings, and service dependencies.

By defining the desired state of the application in the docker-compose.yml file, Docker can automatically create, start, and manage the interconnected containers. This ensures consistent and reproducible deployments across various environments. The docker-compose.yml script acts as a blueprint for orchestrating the containers and their configurations, enabling you to easily manage and scale complex applications with efficiency and ease. 

**Under the Services >>db>>image change to :**

```sh
mysql/mysql-server:8.0
``` 
:::note
